A dictionary of special terms for the Data Package Standard.

## Language

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY`, and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Definitions

### Profile

A profile is a URL that `MUST`:

- resolves to a valid JSON Schema descriptor under the `draft-07` version
- be versioned and immutable i.e. once published under some version it cannot be changed

A profile is both used as a metadata version identifier and the location of a JSON Schema against which a descriptor having it as a root level `$schema` property `MUST` be valid and `MUST` be validated.

Similarly to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/schema#schema), the `$schema` property has effect only on the root level of a descriptor. For example, if a Table Dialect is published as a file it can include a `$schema` property that affects its validation. If the same dialect is an object inlined into a Data Package descriptor, the dialect's `$schema` property `MUST` be ignored and the descriptor as whole `MUST` be validated against a root level `$schema` property provided by the package.

Data Package Standard employes profiles as a mechanism for creating extensions as per [Extensions](/standard/extensions) specification.

:::note[Implementation Note]
It is recommended to cache profiles using their URL as a unique key.

### Descriptor

The Data Package Standard uses a concept of a `descriptor` to represent metadata defined according to the core specefications such as Data Package or Table Schema.

On logical level, a descriptor is represented by a data structure. The data structure `MUST` be a JSON `object` as defined in [RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

On physical level, a descriptor is represented by a file. The file `MUST` contain a valid JSON `object` as defined in [RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

This specification does not define any discoverability mechanisms. Any URI can be used to directly reference a file containing a descriptor.

:::note[File Formats]
A descriptor `MAY` be serialized using alternative formats like YAML or TOML as an internal part of some project or system if supported by corresponding implementations. A descriptor `SHOULD NOT` be externally published in any other format rather than JSON.

#### Custom Properties

The Data Package specifications define a set of standard properties to be used and allows custom properties to be added. It is `RECOMMENDED` to use `namespace:property` naming convention for custom properties. It is `RECOMMENDED` to use [lower camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) convention for naming custom properties, for example, `namespace:propertyName`.

Adherence to a specification does not imply that additional, non-specified properties cannot be used: a descriptor `MAY` include any number of properties in additional to those described as required and optional properties. For example, if you were storing time series data and wanted to list the temporal coverage of the data in the Data Package you could add a property `temporal` (cf [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/qualifiers.shtml#temporal)):

```json
{
  "dc:temporal": {
    "name": "19th Century",
    "start": "1800-01-01",
    "end": "1899-12-31"
  }
}
```

This flexibility enables specific communities to extend Data Packages as appropriate for the data they manage. As an example, the [Fiscal Data Package](https://fiscal.datapackage.org) specification extends Data Package for publishing and consuming fiscal data.

### URL or Path

A `URL or Path` is a `string` with the following additional constraints:

- `MUST` either be a URL or a POSIX path
- [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator) `MUST` be fully qualified. `MUST` be using either `http`, `https`, `ftp`, or `ftps` scheme. (Absence of a scheme indicates `MUST` be a POSIX path)
- [POSIX paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#POSIX_pathname_definition) (unix-style with `/` as separator) are supported for referencing local files, with the security restraint that they `MUST` be relative siblings or children of the descriptor. Absolute paths `/`, relative parent paths `../`, hidden folders starting from a dot `.hidden` `MUST NOT` be used.

Example of aÂ fully qualified url:

```json
{
  "path": "http://ex.datapackages.org/big-csv/my-big.csv"
}
```

Example of a relative path that this will work both as a relative path on disk and online:

```json
{
  "path": "my-data-directory/my-csv.csv"
}
```

:::caution[Security]
`/` (absolute path) and `../` (relative parent path) are forbidden to avoid security vulnerabilities when implementing data package software. These limitations on resource `path` ensure that resource paths only point to files within the data package directory and its subdirectories. This prevents data package software being exploited by a malicious user to gain unintended access to sensitive information. For example, suppose a data package hosting service stores packages on disk and allows access via an API. A malicious user uploads a data package with a resource path like `/etc/passwd`. The user then requests the data for that resource and the server naively opens `/etc/passwd` and returns that data to the caller.

### Tabular Data

Tabular data consists of a set of rows. Each row has a set of fields (columns). We usually expect that each row has the same set of fields and thus we can talk about _the_ fields for the table as a whole.

In case of tables in spreadsheets or CSV files we often interpret the first row as a header row, giving the names of the fields. By contrast, in other situations, e.g. tables in SQL databases, the field names are explicitly designated.

To illustrate, here's a classic spreadsheet table:

```text
field     field
  |         |
  |         |
  V         V

 A     |    B    |    C    |    D      <--- Row (Header)
 ------------------------------------
 valA  |   valB  |  valC   |   valD    <--- Row
 ...
```

In JSON, a table would be:

```json
[
  { "A": value, "B": value, ... },
  { "A": value, "B": value, ... },
  ...
]
```

### Data Representation

In order to talk about the representation and processing of tabular data from text-based sources, it is useful to introduce the concepts of the _physical_ and the _logical_ representation of data.

The _physical representation_ of data refers to the representation of data as text on disk, for example, in a CSV or JSON file. This representation can have some _type_ information (JSON, where the primitive types that JSON supports can be used) or not (CSV, where all data is represented in string form).

The _logical representation_ of data refers to the "ideal" representation of the data in terms of primitive types, data structures, and relations, all as defined by the specification. We could say that the specification is about the logical representation of data, as well as about ways in which to handle conversion of a physical representation to a logical one.

In this document, we'll explicitly refer to either the _physical_ or _logical_ representation in places where it prevents ambiguity for those engaging with the specification, especially implementors.

For example, `constraints` `SHOULD` be tested on the logical representation of data, whereas a property like `missingValues` applies to the physical representation of the data.
