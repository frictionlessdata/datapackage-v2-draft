One of the key strengths of the Data Package Standard lies in its extensibility. While the standard provides a solid foundation for organizing and describing data, it also recognizes that diverse datasets have unique requirements. Data practitioners can extend the standard by incorporating custom metadata, validation rules, or specific constraints to suit their data's peculiarities. Below is the list of well-known Data Package extensions:

## Domain Specific
