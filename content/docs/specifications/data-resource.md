A simple format to describe and package a single data resource such as a individual table or file. The essence of a Data Resource is a locator for the data it describes. A range of other properties can be declared to provide a richer set of metadata.

## Language

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY`, and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

## Example

A minimal Data Resource looks as follows:

With data accessible via the local filesystem.

```json
{
  "name": "resource-name",
  "path": "resource-path.csv"
}
```

With data accessible via http.

```json
{
  "name": "resource-name",
  "path": "http://example.com/resource-path.csv"
}
```

A minimal Data Resource pointing to some inline data looks as follows.

```json
{
  "name": "resource-name",
  "data": {
    "resource-name-data": [{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }]
  }
}
```

A comprehensive Data Resource example with all required, recommended and optional properties looks as follows.

```json
{
  "name": "solar-system",
  "path": "http://example.com/solar-system.csv",
  "title": "The Solar System",
  "description": "My favourite data about the solar system.",
  "format": "csv",
  "mediatype": "text/csv",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bytes": 1,
  "hash": ...,
  "schema": ...,
  "sources": [ ... ],
  "licenses": [ ... ]
}
```

## Descriptor

A Data Resource descriptor `MUST` be a valid JSON `object`. (JSON is defined in [RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)).

## Properties

Standard properties of the descriptor are described below. A descriptor `MAY` include any number of properties in additional to those described below as required and optional properties.

### `name` [required]

A resource `MUST` contain a `name` property. The name is a simple name or identifier to be used for this resource.

- It `MUST` be unique amongst all resources in this data package.
- It `SHOULD` be human-readable and consist only of lowercase alphanumeric characters plus `.`, `-` and `\_`.
- It would be usual for the name to correspond to the file name (minus the extension) of the data file the resource describes.

### `path` or `data` [required]

A resource `MUST` contain a property describing the location of the data associated to the resource. The location of resource data `MUST` be specified by the presence of one (and only one) of these two properties:

- `path`: for data in files located online or locally on disk.
- `data`: for data inline in the descriptor itself.

#### Single File

If a resource have only a single file then `path` `MUST` be a string that a "url-or-path" as defined in [URL of Path](#url-or-path) section.

#### Multiple Files

Usually, a resource will have only a single file associated to it. However, sometimes it can be convenient to have a single resource whose data is split across multiple files -- perhaps the data is large and having it in one file would be inconvenient.

To support this use case the `path` property `MAY` be an array of strings rather than a single string:

```json
{
  "path": ["myfile1.csv", "myfile2.csv"]
}
```

It is NOT permitted to mix fully qualified URLs and relative paths in a `path` array: strings `MUST` either all be relative paths or all URLs.

:::note
All files in the array `MUST` be similar in terms of structure, format etc. Implementors `MUST` be able to concatenate together the files in the simplest way and treat the result as one large file. For tabular data there is the issue of header rows. See the [Tabular Data Package spec](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) for more on this.
:::

#### Inline Data

Resource data rather than being stored in external files can be shipped `inline` on a Resource using the `data` property.

The value of the data property can be any type of data. However, restrictions of JSON require that the value be a string so for binary data you will need to encode (e.g. to Base64). Information on the type and encoding of the value of the data property SHOULD be provided by the format (or mediatype) property and the encoding property.

The value of the data property `MUST` be either:

- **JSON array or object**: the data is then assumed to be JSON data and SHOULD be processed as such
- **JSON string**: in this case the format or mediatype properties `MUST` be provided.

Thus, a consumer of resource object `MAY` assume if no format or mediatype property is provided that the data is JSON and attempt to process it as such.

For example, inline JSON:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "format": "json",
      "data": [{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

Or inline CSV:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "format": "csv",
      "data": "A,B,C\n1,2,3\n4,5,6"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note[Backward Compatibility]
Prior to release 1.0.0-beta.18 (Nov 17 2016) there was a `url` property distinct from `path`. In order to support backwards compatibility, implementors `MAY` want to automatically convert a `url` property to a `path` property and issue a warning.
:::

### `profile`

A string identifying the profile of this descriptor as per the [profiles](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/profiles/) specification.

Examples:

```json
{
  "profile": "tabular-data-resource"
}
```

```json
{
  "profile": "http://example.com/my-profiles-json-schema.json"
}
```

### `title`

Title or label for the resource.

### `description`

Description of the resource.

### `format`

Would be expected to be the standard file extension for this type of resource.For example, `csv`, `xls`, `json` etc.

### `mediatype`

Te mediatype/mimetype of the resource e.g. "text/csv", or "application/vnd.ms-excel". Mediatypes are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in a [media type registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

### `encoding`

The character encoding of resource's data file (only applicable for textual files). The value `SHOULD` be one of the "Preferred MIME Names" for [a character encoding registered with IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml). If no value for this property is specified then the encoding `SHOULD` be detected on the implementation level. It is `RECOMMENDED` to use UTF-8 (without BOM) as a default encoding for textual files.

### `bytes`

Size of the file in bytes.

### `hash`

The MD5 hash for this resource. Other algorithms can be indicated by prefixing the hash's value with the algorithm name in lower-case. For example:

```json
{
  "hash": "sha1:8843d7f92416211de9ebb963ff4ce28125932878"
}
```

### `sources`

List of data sources as for [Data Package](../data-package/#sources).

### `licenses`

List of licenses as for [Data Package](../data-package/#licenses). If not specified the resource inherits from the data package.

### `schema`

A Data Resource `MAY` have a `schema` property to describe the schema of the resource data.

The value for the `schema` property on a `resource` MUST be an `object` representing the schema OR a `string` that identifies the location of the schema.

If a `string` it must be a [url-or-path as defined above](#url-or-path), that is a fully qualified http URL or a relative POSIX path. The file at the location specified by this url-or-path string `MUST` be a JSON document containing the schema.

NOTE: the Data Package specification places no restrictions on the form of the schema Object. This flexibility enables specific communities to define schemas appropriate for the data they manage. As an example, the [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) specification requires the schema to conform to [Table Schema](../table-schema/).

## URL or Path

A `url-or-path` is a `string` with the following additional constraints:

- `MUST` either be a URL or a POSIX path
- [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator) `MUST` be fully qualified. `MUST` be using either http or https scheme. (Absence of a scheme indicates `MUST` be a POSIX path)
- [POSIX paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#POSIX_pathname_definition) (unix-style with `/` as separator) are supported for referencing local files, with the security restraint that they `MUST` be relative siblings or children of the descriptor. Absolute paths `/`, relative parent paths `../`, hidden folders starting from a dot `.hidden` `MUST` NOT be used.

Example of aÂ fully qualified url:

```json
{
  "path": "http://ex.datapackages.org/big-csv/my-big.csv"
}
```

Example of a relative path that this will work both as a relative path on disk and online:

```json
{
  "path": "my-data-directory/my-csv.csv"
}
```

:::caution[Security]
`/` (absolute path) and `../` (relative parent path) are forbidden to avoid security vulnerabilities when implementing data package software. These limitations on resource `path` ensure that resource paths only point to files within the data package directory and its subdirectories. This prevents data package software being exploited by a malicious user to gain unintended access to sensitive information. For example, suppose a data package hosting service stores packages on disk and allows access via an API. A malicious user uploads a data package with a resource path like `/etc/passwd`. The user then requests the data for that resource and the server naively opens `/etc/passwd` and returns that data to the caller.
